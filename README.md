## Why?
Ever save countless place recommendations from social media? I know I do, and when its time to actually visit them I have to dig through my phone in order to find them (or give up midway through). What if there was an easier way to save them? and not only that, save by category, filter and even share with my friends? Point It was made.

## Key Features
* <b>Dynamic & Dynamic POIs</b>
   - Allows users to save POIs with custom name, location, category and description!
* <b>Custom POI Lists</b>
  - Arrange and filter POIs by YOUR custom lists!
* <b>Share with Friends!</b>
  - upcoming ;)
* <b>Integration with the Google Maps API</b>
   - Tracks real time location and place suggestions!
* <b>Be notified when a POI is nearby</b>
   - Notifies which POIs are 5 minutes away in a 800m circle!
* <b>Works offline</b>
